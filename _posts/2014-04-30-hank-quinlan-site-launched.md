Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}

```javascript
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
